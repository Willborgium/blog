                        <p>It's been a long time since I posted any updates on Bizio development, and I'm excited to say the project continues! Here's what I want to cover in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did we leave off?</li>
<li>Why did development pause for so long?</li>
<li>What are we doing now?</li>
</ul>
<h1>Where did we leave off?</h1>
<p>I left Bizio in a relatively good state; my previous &quot;Let's Play&quot; post summarized where things were as far as gameplay pretty well. There were a few major objectives coming up, most notably art and simulation visualization. I knew this would be a hurdle since this is a solo project and I'm not an artist, so I took a break that ultimately turned into a long development pause. This version of Bizio was &quot;always online&quot; because the server was what saved progress and processed turns. At this point, I had a cheap Azure server hosting the development server, so the game was technically playable and distributable. Account signup worked and content delivery seemed fine. So overall the game was in a good state technically. The other major thing that needed to be addressed was playability and balance. All of the skills and projects and AI were nonsensical because I had only been playtesting a handful of turns at a time.</p>
<h1>Why did development pause for so long?</h1>
<p>Life happens! Since this extended break started, I've had two wonderful kids, changed jobs, and COVID-19 caused the whole world to pause. All things considered though, two major factors were limiting me technically from being motivated to finish the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no art, and I'm not an artist, so how do I solve this problem?</li>
<li>The &quot;always online&quot; aspect felt heavy-handed across the system and made development and testing so tedious</li>
</ul>
<p>I know the lack of art shouldn't have stopped me, but it often does with my side projects. That's why I often consider my side projects as little tinkerings rather than big projects that I expect to complete. Bizio is the most mature side project I've ever worked on, and the lofty technical implementation wouldn't be complete without also having a complex art component to it. The way I wanted to dynamically create and represent different people and their interactions in the simulation meant a lot of art assets needed to be created. And while I could get along for a while with developer art, I knew I wouldn't be satisfied.</p>
<p>The always online aspect originated for two reasons: I wanted to build my own client-server app from the ground up to learn the complexities involved first hand, and I wanted to eventually support multiplayer. I got what I wanted with respect to learning: Bizio helped me learn so much about authorization, authentication, and API design. But I never landed anything with regards to multiplayer; I oftened deferred any such implementation to &quot;the future&quot; because I needed to get something working first. In honesty, this is probably the result of being too lofty with my original goals and realizing too late that this was a huge task to undertake myself.</p>
<h1>What are we doing now?</h1>
<p>Well I created a new empty project and decided to simplify the architecture first. Not all is lost: I was able to port and patch about 90% of what I had previously done into a standalone desktop app with no server-side dependencies. That means right now we've got almost everything from the previous video working locally in a self-contained app. There's also a been a large reduction in complexity and volume of code thanks to these changes, and also some UI bug fixes for &quot;free&quot; thanks to the nature of processing the turns locally. Now the priorities are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get back to parity with the previous demo</li>
<li>Playtest and balance the game</li>
<li>Come up with a plan for art</li>
</ul>
<p>Parity is the most straightforward aspect here: it's just a matter of finishing the port. Playtesting has been prioritized because the fun of this game doesn't depend on the visuals (to me at this moment) and I can concurrently discuss art while balancing the numbers. The hope is that this comes together in such a way that #this year# we may have a playable, distributable, and visually compelling alpha for Bizio!</p>
<p>I'll try to post more often about the game and development ideas in general, but for now: WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS!</p>
